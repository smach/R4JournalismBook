Welcome to the GitHub repo for my book, [Practical R for Mass Communications and Journalism](https://www.crcpress.com/Practical-R-for-Mass-Communication-and-Journalism/Machlis/p/book/9781138726918). Now available from [CRC Press](https://www.crcpress.com/Practical-R-for-Mass-Communication-and-Journalism/Machlis/p/book/9781138726918) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Mass-Communication-Journalism-Chapman/dp/1138726915/)!

This site includes post-publication [updates and errata](https://smach.github.io/R4JournalismBook/Updates.html). Note: The best way to let me know about suggested updates and corrections is by [opening an issue in the book's GitHub repository](https://github.com/smach/R4JournalismBook/issues).

You can read sample chapters at [http://www.machlis.com/R4Journalists/](http://www.machlis.com/R4Journalists/) including:

* Get Started With R in a Few Easy Steps
* See How Much You Can Do in a Few Lines of Code
* Import Data into R
* Basic Data Exploration
* Putting it all Together: R on Election Day

The book's GitHub repo (permalink at [https://github.com/smach/R4JournalismBook](https://github.com/smach/R4JournalismBook)) features companion data files the book, as well as [links to additional data and resources](https://smach.github.io/R4JournalismBook/booklinks.html). 

Note that to make language in this repository more inclusive, I changed the name of the main branch of the repo from "master" to "main". Please change any file URL references that include "master" to use "main" instead.

You can also see a searchable chart of [tasks covered in the book](HowDoI.html), [functions covered](https://smach.github.io/R4JournalismBook/functions.html), and [packages](https://smach.github.io/R4JournalismBook/packages.html) used.

Thanks for your interest!
